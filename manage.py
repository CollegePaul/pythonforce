"""
Utility script for managing the Django project.  This script mirrors the
default ``manage.py`` file created by ``django-admin startproject`` and
exposes the ``django.core.management`` commandâ€‘line utility.  Having a
``manage.py`` file in the repository makes it easy to run common tasks
like running the development server or applying migrations without
needing to know the underlying Python module names.

Usage examples:

    python manage.py runserver
    python manage.py makemigrations
    python manage.py migrate

Note: Django is not installed in this environment, so executing this
script will raise an ImportError.  It is provided here as part of the
complete example for the user's reference.
